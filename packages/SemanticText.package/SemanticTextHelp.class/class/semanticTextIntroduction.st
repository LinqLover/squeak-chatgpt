'SemanticText: ChatGPT, embedding search, and retrieval-augmented generation for Squeak

Semantics (from ancient Greek semantikÃ³s) refers to the significance or meaning of information. While the normal String and Text classes in Squeak take a syntactic view on text as a sequence of characters and formatting instructions, SemanticText focuses on the sense and understanding of text. This package aims to make semantic context accessible in Squeak by providing the following features:

OpenAI API client: Currently supports chat completions, embeddings, and speech transcription/synthesis. Includes tools for managing rate limits, tracking expenses, and estimating prices for queries.
SemanticConversation: Framework for conversational agents like ChatGPT as well as autonomous agents, including function calling.
ChatGPT: Conversational GUI for Squeak. Supports streaming responses, editing conversations, and defining system messages.
SemanticCorpus: Framework for semantic search, similarity search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG, aka "chat with your data") through the power of text embeddings. Implements a simple yet functional vector database.
Experimental tools such as an integration of semantic search and RAG into Squeak''s Help Browser or Squeak''s mailing list. Enable them in the preferences.
